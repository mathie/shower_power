  <h1>Shower Power</h1>

  <p>
    My son takes long showers. Like 30 minutes. I swear it's costing a fortune,
    but my wife doesn't believe me. This is the sort of lengths I'll go to,
    just to prove my wife wrong.

  <p>
    Plus I just discovered a nifty wee Javascript framework called <%= link_to 'Tangle', 'http://worrydream.com/Tangle/' %>
    that lets you play around with numbers and I wanted something simple to try
    it out with.

<h2>Water coming in</h2>

<div id="waterTemperature">
  <p>
    The water comes into our house at about
    <span data-var="incomingWaterTemperature" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="-10" data-max="20"> &deg;C</span>
    at this time of year. Our boiler then heats it up to about
    <span data-var="heatedWaterTemperature" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="10" data-max="100"> &deg;C</span>
    before it gets mixed with cold water at the shower.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means the boiler needs to heat the water by about
    <span data-var="waterTemperatureDelta"> &deg;C</span>
    in order for me to get that lovely warm shower.
