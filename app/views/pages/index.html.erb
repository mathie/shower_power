  <h1>Shower Power</h1>

  <p>
    My son takes long showers. Like <span data-var="minutesInShower" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="60"> minutes</span>.
    I swear it's costing a fortune, but my wife doesn't believe me. These are
    the sorts of lengths I'll go to, just to prove my wife wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    It turns out, given the other variables below, it costs
    <strong>
      &pound;<span data-var="totalCost" data-format="%.02f"></span>
    </strong>
    every time my son has a shower! He generally showers
    <span data-var="showerFrequency" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="3" data-format="showerFrequency"> </span>
    which means it's costing me
    <strong>
      &pound;<span data-var="annualCost" data-format="%.02f"></span>
    </strong>
    every year, just to keep him clean!
  </p>

  <h2>Water coming in</h2>

  <p>
    The water comes into our house at about
    <span data-var="incomingWaterTemperature" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="-10" data-max="20"> &deg;C</span>
    at this time of year. Our boiler then heats it up to about
    <span data-var="heatedWaterTemperature" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="10" data-max="100"> &deg;C</span>
    before it gets mixed with cold water at the shower.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means the boiler (which is
    <span data-var="boilerEfficiency" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="1" data-step="0.01" data-format="percent"></span>
    efficient at heating water) needs to heat the water by about
    <span data-var="waterTemperatureDelta"> &deg;C</span>
    in order for me to get that lovely warm shower.
  </p>

  <h2>Shower</h2>

  <p>
    Our shower pushes out
    <span data-var="showerFlowRate" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="30"> litres</span>
    of water every minute. That means I'm pouring
    <span data-var="litresOfWater"> litres</span> of water down the drain when I have a shower.
  </p>

  <p>
    The target water temperature for a pleasant shower is
    <span data-var="targetShowerTemperature" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="50">&deg;C</span>.
    In order to get that, we need to mix
    <span data-var="percentageHotWater" data-format="percent"></span> hot water with
    <span data-var="percentageColdWater" data-format="percent"></span> cold. Which means we're heating
    <span data-var="litresOfHotWater" data-format="%d"> litres</span> of hot water for the shower.
  </p>

  <h2>Costs</h2>

  <p>
    It costs us
    <span data-var="gasCost" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0.00" data-max="0.20" data-step="0.001" data-format="pence"></span>
    per kWh for our gas.
